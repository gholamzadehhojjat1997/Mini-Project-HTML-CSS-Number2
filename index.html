      <h3>Bitbucket Server</h3>
      <p>
        Bitbucket Server (formerly known as Stash) is a combination Git server
        and web interface product written in Java and built with Apache Maven.
        It allows users to do basic Git operations (such as reviewing or merging
        code, similar to GitHub) while controlling read and write access to the
        code. It also provides integration with other Atlassian tools
      </p>
      <p>
        Bitbucket Server is a commercial software product that can be licensed
        for running on-premises. Atlassian provides Bitbucket Server for free to
        open source projects meeting certain criteria, and to organizations that
        are non-profit, non-government, non-academic, non-commercial,
        non-political, and secular. For academic and commercial customers, the
        full source code is available under a developer source license.

      <h3>History</h3>
      <p>
        Bitbucket was previously an independent startup company, founded by
        Jesper NÃ¸hr in 2008. On 29 September 2010, Bitbucket was acquired by
        Atlassian. In September 2015, Atlassian renamed their Stash product to
        Bitbucket Server. In July 2016, Bitbucket added support for Git Large
        File Storage (LFS). In March 2020, Bitbucket Server controversially
        dropped support for viewing three way diffs and in July 2020, Bitbucket
        Cloud removed support for its original repository format Mercurial.
